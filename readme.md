2. `cd bokeh`
3. `bokeh serve --show owid`

A webpage should appear after step 3. If not, please contact me at @Seancze on Telegram.

## Tasks
1. Task 1 - Predicting `new_deaths_smoothed_per_million`
2. Task 2 - Predicting `hosp_patients_per_million`

## Data set
Our team would like to credit [Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) for maintaining an excellent data set. Note: The data set used in our analysis was maintained up till 10th November 2021.

## Future work
1. To further test the strength of our model, our model should be tested against future datasets. If the linear regression remains high of > 0.5, it shows that our model is indeed independent of time and is not overfitting the data.
2. Additionally, our model has the potential to be further improved by introducing non-linear models, introducing other features that we were unable to test due to dataset and time limitations or by further transforming our current features.
3. Finally, our model can be improved by choosing a data set with a lower proportion of rows with missing values.
